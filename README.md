# fl_panel

A docking layout for Flutter: a tree of splits, single panels and tab groups
that the user resizes, docks and rearranges, with ordinary Flutter widgets
inside every panel. The shape you know from Blender, Visual Studio and VS
Code — and a file format to bring it back tomorrow.

```dart
final controller = PanelController(
  app: PanelApp(windows: [
    PanelWindow(
      id: 'main',
      root: SplitNode(
        id: 'root',
        axis: PanelAxis.horizontal,
        sizes: const [PanelExtent.fixed(240), PanelExtent.flex(1)],
        children: [
          SinglePanel(id: 'files', tab: PanelTab(id: 'files', contentId: 'files')),
          TabGroup(id: 'editors', tabs: [
            PanelTab(id: 'a', contentId: 'editor', metadata: {'title': 'a.md'}),
            PanelTab(id: 'b', contentId: 'editor', metadata: {'title': 'b.md'}),
          ]),
        ],
      ),
    ),
  ]),
);

PanelHost(
  controller: controller,
  windowId: 'main',
  contentBuilder: (context, tab) => switch (tab.contentId) {
    'files' => const FileTree(),
    _ => Editor(path: tab.metadata['title'] as String),
  },
);
```

## What you get

- **A tree, not a widget tree.** `PanelApp` → `PanelWindow` → `LayoutNode`
  (`SplitNode` / `SinglePanel` / `TabGroup`) → `PanelTab`. Immutable values;
  every edit is a pure function in `LayoutTree`. A tab holds a `contentId` and
  metadata, never a widget: you decide what a tab is.
- **Resizing** with weights and fixed extents, content minimums honoured and
  redistributed, over-constrained layouts scaled together.
- **Docking** at both granularities: drag a tab out of its strip or a whole
  panel by its header; the centre of a leaf joins it, its edges split it, the
  window's edges split everything, a strip inserts at the index. A live preview
  shows where it lands.
- **A tab can become a panel and a panel a tab**, governed by two affinity
  levels: `PanelTab.forms` says which surface forms a content may take, and
  your `DockPolicy` says who may share a strip with whom.
- **State survives moves.** Content is rendered flat and keyed on the tab, so
  a text field keeps its selection when its tab lands in another group.
- **Three tab styles** — `attached` (VS Code), `blended` (Chrome's shoulders,
  painted), `floating` (pills) — per theme or per group, with a
  `PanelDecorations` for icons, an unsaved dot, a strip button and a context
  menu; or replace the whole chrome through `PanelChrome`.
- **Chips shrink to a floor, then the strip scrolls** — by wheel, and by
  `controller.focus(tabId, keyboard: true)`, which activates the tab, brings
  its chip into view and hands its content the keyboard.
- **An editor area that stays**: a `persistent` group keeps its place with
  nothing in it, and a tab can be `closable: false` — a file tree, a console
  — so it moves but never goes.
- **A focused leaf per window**, where `open` puts new content and
  `nextTab`/`closeActive` act; a `closeGuard` for unsaved documents;
  `closeOthers`/`closeToTheRight`; `updateTab` for a title or a flag; and an
  `events` stream (`TabOpened`, `TabClosed`, `TabMoved`, …) for whatever an
  application keeps behind its tabs.
- **Persistence** with an integer `version`: `controller.toJson()`,
  `controller.load(json, resolve: …)`, where the resolver drops tabs this
  build no longer knows and the tree tidies itself.
- **Headless half.** `package:fl_panel/model.dart` imports nothing from
  Flutter: the tree, the edits, the solver, the resolver, the policy and the
  format run in a plain `dart` test or on a server.

## Not yet

Floating panels (the file format reserves the slot), maximise, pinning, and
multi-window hosting — the model already holds several windows and moves tabs
between them; wiring a second engine to a second `PanelHost` is the
application's job.

## Example

`example/` is an IDE-shaped demo: files at a fixed width, editors in the
middle, tools on the right that only group with other tools, a console along
the bottom; a style switcher, a button that opens twelve editors to watch the
strip scroll, a focus menu, a context menu, an unsaved dot that makes the
close guard ask, and save/restore of the layout.

```sh
cd example && flutter run -d linux
```
